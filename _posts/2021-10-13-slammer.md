>A Rover robot built as a learning platform for robotics and based upon several opensource technologies like [ROS](www.ros.org).
>It is also used during the development of [uNAV2 project](https://blog.alessiomorale.com/unav2), an integrated opensource motor control system for robots, built for ROS.
>The robot employs several sensors (3D camera, Lidar & IMU) to sense the surrounding environment, build a map and navigate through it autonomously (SLAM, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) avoiding obstacles and blockages.
